    "The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python. It returns a file object that allows you to perform various operations on the file, such as reading, writing, or appending data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function takes two parameters: the file name or path and the mode in which the file should be opened. The mode determines the type of operations that can be performed on the file. Here are the different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"r\" (Read Mode):** This is the default mode when no mode is specified. It allows you to read the contents of an existing file. If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` will be raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"w\" (Write Mode):** This mode is used to create a new file or overwrite the contents of an existing file. If the file already exists, its previous content will be deleted. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"a\" (Append Mode):** This mode allows you to append data to an existing file. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created. The data will be added at the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **\"x\" (Exclusive Creation Mode):** This mode is used to create a new file but raises a `FileExistsError` if the file already exists. It ensures that a file with the same name does not get overwritten accidentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **\"b\" (Binary Mode):** This mode is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., \"rb\", \"wb\", \"ab\") to open a file in binary format. It is used for reading or writing non-text files, such as images or binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **\"t\" (Text Mode):** This mode is the default mode for handling text files. It is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., \"rt\", \"wt\", \"at\") to specify that the file should be treated as a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **\"+\" (Update Mode):** This mode allows you to both read and write to a file. It is used in conjunction with other modes (e.g., \"r+\", \"w+\", \"a+\") to enable both reading and writing operations on the file. However, it is important to note that using this mode can be more complex and requires careful handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few examples to illustrate the different modes of opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read mode\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Write mode\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",

    "The `close()` function is used to close an opened file in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it. Closing a file releases system resources associated with the file and ensures that any pending writes are flushed to disk. Here are a few reasons why closing a file is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Release system resources:** When a file is opened, the operating system allocates certain resources to handle the file operations. These resources may include memory, file descriptors, or other system-level structures. Closing the file using `close()` frees up these resources, allowing other processes or parts of your program to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flush pending writes:** When you write data to a file, it is not immediately written to the underlying storage. Instead, it is buffered in memory for efficiency. Closing the file with `close()` ensures that any pending writes are flushed and written to the disk. This guarantees that your data is persisted correctly and prevents data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prevent resource leaks:** If you open a large number of files without closing them, it can lead to resource leaks. Eventually, you may run out of available file descriptors or memory, which can cause your program to crash or exhibit unpredictable behavior. By closing files when you're done with them, you avoid such resource leaks and keep your program running smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensure data integrity:** Closing a file properly helps to ensure the integrity of the data being written. If a file is not closed, unexpected program termination or system crashes may result in incomplete or corrupted data. By explicitly closing the file, you minimize the risk of data corruption and ensure that your data is stored correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a file, you can simply call the `close()` method on the file object, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "# Perform operations on the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use the `with` statement, which automatically takes care of closing the file for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "    # The file will be automatically closed at the end of the block\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **`read()` method:**\n",
    "The `read()` method is used to read the entire content of a file as a string. It reads the file from the current position of the file pointer until the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the content\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `read()` method is called on the file object. It reads the entire content of the file and assigns it to the variable `content`. The content is then printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`readline()` method:**\n",
    "The `readline()` method is used to read a single line from a file. It reads the characters from the current position of the file pointer until it encounters a newline character (`\\n`) or reaches the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    line1 = file.readline()\n",
    "    line2 = file.readline()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the lines\n",
    "print(line1)\n",
    "print(line2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `readline()` method is called twice. The first call reads the first line of the file and assigns it to `line1`. The second call reads the second line and assigns it to `line2`. Both lines are then printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`readlines()` method:**\n",
    "The `readlines()` method is used to read all the lines of a file and return them as a list of strings. Each line is represented as an individual string element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",

    "The `with` statement is used in conjunction with the `open()` function when working with files in Python. It provides a convenient and safe way to open and handle files by automatically taking care of resource management, including opening and closing the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary advantage of using the `with` statement with `open()` is that it ensures proper handling of the file, even in the presence of exceptions or errors. Here's why using `with` and `open()` together is advantageous:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic resource management:** The `with` statement guarantees that the file will be properly closed, even if an exception occurs within the block. It automatically takes care of resource management, ensuring that system resources associated with the file are released, regardless of the outcome of the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplified code syntax:** By using the `with` statement, you don't need to explicitly call the `close()` method to close the file. The `with` statement handles it for you. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable by reducing the need for repetitive boilerplate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Prevents resource leaks:** Forgetting to close a file can lead to resource leaks, where system resources are not released properly. Opening a large number of files without closing them can exhaust system resources and impact the performance of your program. The `with` statement ensures that files are always closed, preventing resource leaks and maintaining optimal resource utilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cleaner exception handling:** If an exception occurs within the block of code, the `with` statement guarantees that the file will be closed before propagating the exception further. This ensures that any pending writes are flushed and data integrity is maintained. It also allows for more robust and cleaner exception handling, as you don't need to worry about explicitly closing the file in each exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that illustrates the usage of `with` and `open()` together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # Perform operations on the file\n",
    "    # The file will be automatically closed at the end of the block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `with` statement is used to open the file \"example.txt\" in read mode (`\"r\"`). The block of code within the `with` statement can perform any desired operations on the file. Once the block is exited, either normally or due to an exception, the `with` statement ensures that the file is closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the `with` statement and the `open()` function, you achieve more robust and efficient file handling, with improved code readability and proper resource management."

    "This is an example file.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`writelines()` function:**\n",
    "The `writelines()` function is used to write a list of strings to a file. Each string in the list is written as a separate line. It does not add any extra characters, such as newlines, between the strings.\n",

    "\n",
    "After executing the code, the file \"example.txt\" will be created (or overwritten if it already exists) and contain the following content:\n",
