    "Here are the key reasons why the `abc` module is used:\n",
    "\n",

    "Data abstraction can be achieved in Python through the following techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in achieving data abstraction. It involves bundling data and methods together within a class. The data is encapsulated within the class, and access to it is controlled through well-defined methods (getters and setters). By encapsulating data, the internal representation and implementation details are hidden from the outside world, promoting abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access Modifiers: Python provides access modifiers to control the visibility of attributes and methods. By convention, an attribute or method prefixed with a single underscore (`_`) indicates it as a non-public member, meaning it is intended for internal use within the class. By using access modifiers, we can hide certain attributes or methods from direct access, further enhancing data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Property Decorators: Python's property decorators (`@property`, `@<attribute>.setter`, `@<attribute>.deleter`) allow us to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for attributes. This allows us to control the access and modification of attribute values while maintaining abstraction. By using property decorators, we can define custom behavior when getting or setting an attribute value.\n"
