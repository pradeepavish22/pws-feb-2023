    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and related behaviors (methods) together within a class, hiding the internal implementation details from outside access. It allows for the protection and controlled access to the data, ensuring that it is accessed and modified only through defined methods. In Python, encapsulation can be achieved by using access modifiers such as public, private, and protected, though Python follows a convention-based approach rather than strict enforcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. A class that inherits from another class is called a subclass or derived class, while the class being inherited from is called a superclass or base class. Inheritance enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and supports the creation of specialized classes that inherit and extend the functionality of their parent classes. In Python, a class can inherit from another class by specifying the base class in parentheses after the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to exhibit different behaviors based on their data type or class. It allows different objects to respond differently to the same message or method call. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding involves redefining a method in the subclass to provide its own implementation, while method overloading involves defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. Python supports both forms of polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by representing essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining interfaces, abstract classes, and methods that provide a high-level view of the functionality, without exposing the internal implementation. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, promoting code reusability, and enhancing maintainability. In Python, abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes, which are classes that cannot be instantiated directly but serve as a blueprint for subclasses to implement specific functionality.\n",
