    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of code. It is a mechanism provided by the language to handle and respond to various types of errors or exceptional situations that may arise during program execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be raised explicitly using the `raise` statement or can be raised implicitly by the Python interpreter when it encounters an error condition. When an exception is raised, it interrupts the normal execution of the program and searches for an appropriate exception handler to handle the exception. If no suitable handler is found, the program terminates and displays an error message along with a traceback.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, syntax errors are different from exceptions. Syntax errors occur when the syntax of a Python program is incorrect, violating the rules and grammar of the language. These errors are usually detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing stage, before the program is executed. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, as they indicate a problem in the structure or format of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors are detected during the parsing stage before the program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to recover from error conditions and continue executing. Syntax errors cannot be handled since they prevent the program from running in the first place. Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code's syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Source: Exceptions can arise from various sources, including runtime errors, I/O operations, arithmetic errors, or explicit raising of exceptions. Syntax errors, on the other hand, stem from mistakes in the code's structure or syntax, such as missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Error Messages: Exceptions provide detailed error messages and traceback information that help in identifying and debugging the cause of the error. Syntax errors, when encountered, display a specific error message pointing to the line and location where the syntax error occurred.\n",

    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it propagates up the call stack until it reaches the highest level of the program, and if no exception handler is found, it results in the program termination. This termination is accompanied by an error message and a traceback that provides information about the exception and the sequence of function calls that led to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "def perform_calculation():\n",
    "    result = divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Division by zero\n",
    "    print(\"Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    perform_calculation()\n",
    "\n",
    "main()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `divide_numbers()` function attempts to divide two numbers but encounters a division by zero error. When `perform_calculation()` is called, it invokes `divide_numbers(10, 0)`, which results in a `ZeroDivisionError` being raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no exception handler specifically designed to handle `ZeroDivisionError`, the exception propagates up the call stack to the `perform_calculation()` function. Since there is no exception handler there either, the exception continues to propagate to the `main()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main()` function, no exception handler is present either, so the exception continues to propagate. At this point, the default exception handler provided by the Python interpreter takes over, resulting in the program termination.\n",
    "\n",
    "The termination of the program is accompanied by an error message that indicates the type of exception (`ZeroDivisionError`) and a traceback that shows the sequence of function calls leading up to the unhandled exception. The traceback provides valuable information for debugging and identifying the cause of the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling exceptions is essential to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from terminating abruptly. By providing appropriate exception handlers, you can control how the program responds to exceptions, whether it's by displaying an error message, logging the exception, or implementing specific error recovery mechanisms."

This allows you to write specific exception handlers for each type of exception, providing more precise error handling and appropriate actions based on the exceptional condition.\n",

    "3. **Hierarchical exception handling:** Custom exceptions can be organized in a hierarchical manner, with parent and child exception classes.
